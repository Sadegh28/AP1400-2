**Description:** 
<p align="justify">Nowadays, programming is one of the most needed skills. In this course, we'll learn some topics of advanced programming. Object-Oriented programming, data structure and algorithm analysis are the most important ones. Although all of these topics are independent of a special programming language, we use one of the most liked programming languages, which is <a  href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python!</a> We chose Python because it's simple and open source. In this course, most of our focus is on your Teamwork and programming activities. You'll learn Object-Oriented programming, and you'll have to implement a project as a final Teamwork result. At the end you'll be expected to write classes, use data structures and design a graphical user interface for your project.
